## TwoSum Leetcode Problem Solution
### This program is used to solve the [TwoSum Leetcode problem] (https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum) on language rust.
### To use, this: there are multiple purposes and methods. If you want to use this program to help you in understanding rust's structure, you can simply clone this and go to the src/main.rs file and read the code. it's pretty simple to understand. But, if you want to use this program to clear the leetcode problem, go to the problem submissions and submit the Solution type implementation (L2-L15), although You won't learn anything from copy pasting. That being said, you can use this program for any purpose. It is up to you. Anyways, thank you for reading this. This was just a small project made by me.
